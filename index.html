      <h1>Jerry Pallath</h1>
      <p style="text-align: left">Ah! You've found yourself at my corner of the internet. I'm Jerry Pallath, and in the next few pages, I'm going to show you why I am the best choice to add to your team. (This website should be more than an online profile though.)</p>

      <p style="text-align: left">I'm really good at what I do. I'm a Web Developer-- I'm experienced professionally in the Front-End but I've always had the skills to work in the Back-End, too. I like solving puzzles, but I love building the puzzle pieces more.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left">I started my professional career in Web Development through General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program back in May 2015. Through that, I developed skills in the obvious web programming tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; but they also got around to teaching me more advanced things like Node.js, Ruby, and Angular. While working at Mediaplanet I developed a more nuanced control over CSS and Javascript (jQuery) and I've gained an appreciation towards PHP (My vocabulary with various languages is just getting bigger).</p>

      <p style="text-align: left">Currently in my free time, I'm teaching myself Facebook's React-Native. I have a feeling that this code is really important to the future of Web and Mobile Development.  I like listening to a lot of music (mostly hip-hop and rock music from the early 00’s).  I’m super proud of my list of podcasts I listen to, I’ll pull out my Pocketcasts app whenever I have the chance to just show it off.  </p>

      <p style="text-align: left">I'm hoping that you're liking what you see here, and you stay awhile and start visualizing me as one of your go to teammates.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;">In the next few pages, I’ll be stressing what skills I can bring to your team, what I’ve accomplished, and also my most up to date resume.</p>

      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <h5>Mediaplanet Group</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left">I've been at Mediaplanet since October 2015. It helped build my developmental, IT, and business skills.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left">While working here, I've worked with their proprietary CMS (Content Management System) and CRM (Customer Relationship Management) Servers. Both utilized PHP has the main back-end language but were flexible enough to employ HTML/CSS and JavaScript (jQuery).</p>

      <p style="text-align: left">I worked primarily in the CMS. I worked on maintenance and upkeep of the delivery of the system, but I also spent a lot of time innovating it with new page structures and widgets (tools that we deliver within our article pages). A lot of the new projects I worked on as a sort of side activity soon became adopted company wide.  These projects include the new layout of our content hubs, the style of our blogs, and the implementation of new pages to sell our product.</p>

      <p style="text-align: left">I wasn't only a developer for Mediaplanet. I served as the IT Support for the company. As IT Support, I helped with day to day troubleshoots and system maintenance. A major role I played in 2016 was setting up a more secured and defined Local Network in our New York and Toronto offices.</p>

      <h5>General Assembly Web Development Immersive</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left">I learned the majority of my Web Development skills from General Assembly.  I could say that I already knew the basics from hobbies I had throughout my school years (such as maintaining my xanga or myspace).  General Assembly just gave me a more professional output to my work along with introducing me to more advanced forms of coding that have pushed my excitement to what I can bring in innovation to the places I work.</p>

      <h5>New York University</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left; padding-bottom: 20px;">At New York University, I spent a majority of my time as a Premed student, but I was always bored with those classes.  I found that my computer classes for Java and Python tended to make me more excited about my day to day.  I did finish up my Premed at New York University but I had a hunger to flex my skills in development more than just spend more years of school to learn actual medicine.  New York University whetted my appetite for Technology and I went on chasing new avenues after college to satisfy that appetite!</p>

    <div class="projects">
      <h1>Projects</h1>
      <h5>Enterprise 2.0 Web Interface Update </h5>
      <p style="text-align: left;">This is the most abstract of all my accomplishments while I worked at Mediaplanet.  I worked closely with designers to update the look and feel our content hubs to make a more mobile accessible webpage.  This meant reduce padding of specific headers, remove extraneous data, and improve the visibility of the msot important data.  This is definitely something that needs to explained more in person than anything else I've worked on.  This involved some back-end involvement (PHP) but was primarily a front-end job that utilized finte tuned control of CSS and Javascript (jQuery).</p>
      <h5>Mediaplanet Blog Style Update </h5>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Developed a better workflow to present our company's blog posts</p>
      <p style="text-align: left;">Built a definite stylesheet/script that follows a styleguide that I was responsible to dictate.  This made our main image choices more apparent and interesting.  Our posts became more readable and inviting to look at.  I updated both the main blog page and the individual article pages behind the blog. The improvements were made for the mobile and desktop levels.  <a href="https://www.mediaplanet.com/en/blog/latest-news">Mediaplanet Blog Page</a></p>
      <h5>Adportal Landing Page</h5>
      <p style="text-align: left">  This was my first major project at Mediaplanet.  I was asked to make a landing page for our clients to drop their Ads into our server.  During the initial discussions, I asked if it was possible to give the page an interesting look and feel-- to make it feel like a fully thought out product.  Along with this, other members of the company asked if specific pages could be offered on this page including our Terms and Conditions, and our Technical Specifications for our various products.  With all of the information I was given, I built out a page that could serve all of these services</p>
      <p style="text-align: left">The rest of the company was excited with the product I built, I was asked to build out a widget/page for every single office in our company.  <a href="https://www.mediaplanet.com/en/advertise-us">This is the US Office's version</a> which was my first and most built out version of the product.  This version is desktop and mobile compatible.</p>
      <h5>Project Dibs </h5>
      <p style="text-align: left">An independently full-stack app built for the intention of allowing users to share their ideas of ways they would improve media including film, music, and pop-culture.</p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">Built a fully functioning app that allowed users to store their information and track their participation in the app such as comments and “upvotes” through Node.js and MongoDB.</p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">Built a beautiful fully functioning app that appeals to the user’s eyes as much as his intuition by developing a thorough understanding of the design philosophies highlighted in Google’s Material Design Light.</p>
      <h5>PickUpandGo.co </h5>
      <p style="text-align: left">A collaborated app with the intention of allowing users to create and find pick up sports throughout their city.</p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">Allowed an easier log-in experience for the user of the app by implementing OmniAuth and Facebook API.</p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">Developed an interactive database that allowed users information to be saved, allow them to create and save
      games, and find a full history of the games that they made and participated through PostGreSQL.</p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">Served sensible information from the database to the user’s browser through Front-End using HTML, CSS,
      and Embedded Ruby.</p>
      <h5>Jerrkipedia </h5>
      <p style="text-align:left;">A wiki app build in taking in new information and rendering previously created data.</p>
      <p style="text-align:left;">Allowed the app to take in data and serve it based on user requests by developing a non-relational database
      through MongoDB</p>
      <p style="text-align:left; padding-bottom: 20px;">Developed the entire backend of the application using Node.js with technical skills including Embedded
      JavaScript and JavaScript</p>
